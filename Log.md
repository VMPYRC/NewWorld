## Sole Survivor

*Find out what happened to Captain Thorpe.*

*CAPTAIN THORPE* -- You, come closer... your captain needs you. One of those blasted things jabbed me... in a bad way. That demon storm... a voice in my head... these foul creatures... I don't know what the hell's going on here!

*Captain Thorpe lost the mysterious box at sea and now appears to have perished... but his corpse disintegrated. Find out what happened to him.*

*PLAYER* -- Are we the only survivors?

*CAPTAIN THORPE* -- I think so... I could've sworn I saw one of the swabbies, but it was one of those... creatures. Damned priest! I never should've trusted that bastard - all his talk of legends and power, treasures... nothing but lies. And the box he gave me...

*PLAYER* -- Where is the box?

*CAPTAIN THORPE* -- I-I don't know. I lost it when the ship went down, but this voice... she says I need to get it back! You... I order you! Search the beach... if we don't recover the box... No! Wait...! I will find it! No, please... I can't die here... not like this!

*Retrieve the Items from Captain Thorpe's Satchel*

*Search the Ship Graveyard for Captain Thorpe's Box*

*VOICE* V1 -- You wash up on my shore exhausted and weak... and I welcome you home...

*VOICE* V2 -- You are strong, yes... but you need not fear death... for I am with you...

*VOICE* V3 -- Return to me what was lost... share in my blessings... and join me in everlasting glory.

*Examine the Mysterious Box*

*VOICE* -- What have you done...?!  The source... It was my destiny to claim that!

*Escape the Ship Graveyard*

*Reach Higher Ground*

*Descend into the Grotto*

## Reborn into Corruption

*Captain Thorpe has been consumed by Corruption. You must defeat him.*

*Defeat the Corrupted Captain Thorpe*

*CAPTAIN THORPE* V1 -- Yes, my mistress... I will return what was taken...

*CAPTAIN THORPE* V2 -- I feel your blessings surge within me... everlasting glory will be ours...

*CAPTAIN THORPE* V3 -- Victory is ours, my mistress... their soul is yours to claim...

*VOICE* -- You had the choice... you forced my hand... your soul is now mine.

## Sole Survivor

*Talk to Lleyson Reese*

*WATCHER LLEYSON REESE* -- Hold on to yourself... you'll be alright...

*WATCHER LLEYSON REESE* -- Steady there, friend. Dying can be a rather harrowing experience the first time one goes through it. You're actually looking quite... healthy, all things considered. Luckier than most!

*PLAYER* V1 -- Wait. Am I dead?

*PLAYER* V2 -- I was attacked, there was a flash of light, and then I woke up here. So is that it... I'm actually dead?

*WATCHER LLEYSON REESE* -- Not anymore, but you were very much dead for a few minutes there. You've been resurrected, you see. It's... quite a lot to take in, I know. You'll find many strange things on Aeternum, and this "not dying" business is one of them.

*PLAYER* V1 -- I'm hearing voices too...

*PLAYER* V2 -- This woman just started speaking right into my mind after I came ashore. She either wants to recruit me or destroy me... or maybe both.

*WATCHER LLEYSON REESE* -- Yes, the pull of the Corruption... it's that damn storm - I can't even count the number of ships it's wrecked. And every sailor coming ashore is Corrupted... you're one of the few who came through with your soul intact.

*WATCHER LLEYSON REESE* -- Ah, but I forget my manners! Watcher Lleyson Reese, at your service. I watch these shores for shipwrecks, and help those like yourself. You're undoubtedly quite shaken by all this, and probably famished too... resurrection is taxing on the soul and the body.

## Basic Needs

*PLAYER* V1 -- Do you have food and supplies?

*PLAYER* V2 -- Now that you mention it, it was nothing but hardtack at sea and then... this. Can't say I'd refuse a warm meal.

*WATCHER LLEYSON REESE* -- Unfortunately, we don't keep the watchtower very well stocked. "Bring your own mead," is the rule. But there are some nice, fat boar roaming around nearby... of course, you're not exactly equipped for hunting, are you?

*PLAYER* V1 -- What equipment do I need?

*PLAYER* V2 -- Honestly, I washed ashore with nothing but what I had on my back. I'm making it up as I go, here.

*WATCHER LLEYSON REESE* -- Yes, you'll need a skinning knife to start, unless you prefer your roasted boar with the skin on. If you'll gather some flint and wood on your way to join me at the watchtower, you can fashion a crude knife at the campfire.

*Gather Flint and Wood, craft a Flint Skinning Knife at the Watcher's Campfire, and then talk to Watcher Reese.*

*WATCHER LLEYSON REESE* INC -- Flint, wood, skinning knife. Then we're good to go.

*Gather Flint from the ground*

*Gather Wood from a Bush*

*Craft a Skinning Knife at the Watcher's Campfire*

*WATCHER LLEYSON REESE* -- Very impressive! One of the nicest crude skinning knives I've seen. You've done this before, haven't you?

*WATCHER LLEYSON REESE* V1 MB -- It's important to know how to provide for yourself here - the wilds of Aeternum can be a very... harsh environment. It's reasonably safe up the road in the town of Prydwen, but out here, we're on our own.

*WATCHER LLEYSON REESE* V2 WW -- It's important to know how to provide for yourself here - the wilds of Aeternum can be a very... harsh environment. It's reasonably safe up the road in the town of Corinth, but out here, we're on our own.

## Campfire Feast

*PLAYER* -- Is that the town you came from?"

*WATCHER LLEYSON REESE* -- Yes, it has its own share of troubles, but nothing like what we're seeing here. The persistence of this storm is worrisome, to say the least. I may very well need your help, but as I promised, we need to get you fed first.

*PLAYER* -- Alright. Where do I find these boar?

*WATCHER LLEYSON REESE* -- Yes, you'll find them snuffling around in the bushes nearby - they're ornery, but I think you can handle it. Go and hunt yourself down a fat one, skin it, and cook yourself a little feast at the campfire.

*Hunt and skin a boar, make some light rations at the Watcher's campfire, and then talk to Watcher Reese.*

*WATCHER LLEYSON REESE* INC -- Mmm... boar.

*Equip a Skinning Knife*

*Hunt down a Boar to make yourself a meal*

*Skin a Boar to Collect Meat*

*Cook a Light Ration at the Watcher's Campfire*


*WATCHER LLEYSON REESE* -- Mmm, that smells delicious, and you seem to be feeling better than when you first rejoined the ranks of the living. That's convenient, because I really do need your help to make sure the threat here on the shore is contained.

## Crewmates No More

*WATCHER LLEYSON REESE* -- We get shipwrecks on these shores now and then, but I've never seen anything like this. The storm, all these ships, and the fact everyone's Corrupted except you... well, we have to do something.

*PLAYER* -- What does it mean to be Corrupted?

*WATCHER LLEYSON REESE* -- That's the dark side of eternal life, I suppose. You resurrected with your soul intact, but many come back soulless, the "Lost." Or worse, they return with their souls twisted, possessed by insatiable evil. Those we call the "Corrupted."

*PLAYER* -- Possessed? Like by a demon?

*WATCHER LLEYSON REESE* V1 -- Essentially, yes. And the Corrupted are relentless, destroying and killing to increase their numbers. Looking at the wreckage of your ship, I suspect that's what's become of the rest of your crew.

*WATCHER LLEYSON REESE* V2 -- It's possible, but it's more likely they'll come back without their souls - no soul, no Corruption. They'd be considered soulless 'Lost' at that point, still a threat to the rest of us, but far less immediate.

*PLAYER* -- The ship I arrived on? Where is it?

*WATCHER LLEYSON REESE* V1 -- It's just across the water, and frankly, we need to deal with the Corrupted gathering there. I know it's not a pleasant task, but if you can put down some of your former crewmates... it's a start, at least.

*PLAYER* -- Alright. I'll do it.

*WATCHER LLEYSON REESE* -- Excellent! If the Corrupted start converging on you in numbers, I suggest you retreat. Either way, keep that blade handy. The last thing we need is for you to be joining their ranks.

*WATCHER LLEYSON REESE* -- Excellent!  Of course, you may want something more than that old blade you're carrying around. Take a weapon from the rack over there - whatever strikes your fancy - and then use it to drive back the Corrupted.

*Defeat your Corrupted Crewmates and try to put them back to rest.*

*VOICE* -- And they shall ruthlessly strike down their fellows... their path to Corruption begun...

*WATCHER LLEYSON REESE* INC -- I know it's not easy, but it really is the right thing. Think of it as a mercy - that's what I do.

*Choose a Weapon from the Rack*

*Investigate the Wreckage of the {POITags} and Defeat your Corrupted Crewmates*

*Defeat {targetName} Mariners*

*WATCHER LLEYSON REESE* -- Well done. It's grim work, I know, but we can't let the Corrupted get entrenched down here. Unfortunately, their numbers seem to just keep growing... several shipwrecks along the shore, and more by the hour.

## Amidst the Wreckage

*WATCHER LLEYSON REESE* -- The Stormwall is a fact of life here - it completely surrounds the island, wrecking any ships that approach and any that attempt to leave. But this storm... it's unnatural even by Aeternum standards. There must be something - or someone - causing it.

*PLAYER* -- Who could be causing it?

*WATCHER LLEYSON REESE* -- I'm not sure, but all this wreckage at the same time, it seems like it must be coordinated somehow. We generally see a new shipwreck only once a season, and even then, there are usually more survivors.

*PLAYER* -- Should we search for survivors?

*WATCHER LLEYSON REESE* -- That's likely a lost cause. If they're out there, stuck in the midst of the wreckage, they're probably already Corrupted. More importantly, I need to focus on finding the storm's source, and I couldn't possibly ask you to go alone.

*PLAYER* -- It's alright. I volunteer.

*WATCHER LLEYSON REESE* -- Well, I fear you may not fully grasp the danger of such an endeavor, but I won't hold you back. Just keep that weapon at the ready, and take out as many Corrupted as you can.  If you find survivors, send them here.

*Search the shipwrecks for survivors and take out as many Corrupted as you can. Report back to the Watchtower when you're done.*

*WATCHER LLEYSON REESE* INC -- If you find anyone, send them this way. And for pity's sake, watch your back out there. Don't need you becoming Corrupted as well.

*VOICE* -- This is only the beginning, all these sailors join our cause... soon, it will be all of humanity.

*Search for Survivors at the wreck of the {POITags}*

*GRACE O'MALLEY* V1 -- Eat lead, you bastards! You won't be getting a piece of Grace O'Malley that easy!

*GRACE O'MALLEY* V2 -- Stay back, you bastards! Unless you want to be eating lead!

*Destroy the Corrupted Growths  to help Grace O'Malley*

*GRACE O'MALLEY* V1 -- Hey mate, can you give a girl a hand here? These red-eyed rotters have me pinned down!

*GRACE O'MALLEY* V2 -- Well, fancy seeing another clear-eyed sailor amid this rabble! Could you give a girl a hand, maybe? Clear the space so I can jump down?

*0/3 Corrupted Growth Destroyed*
*1/3 Corrupted Growth Destroyed*
*2/3 Corrupted Growth Destroyed*
*3/3 Corrupted Growth Destroyed*

*GRACE O'MALLEY* V1 -- Ah, back on the sand! You have my thanks. I know a safe spot this way, c'mon...

*GRACE O'MALLEY* V2 -- That's better! Come and follow me this way! I know a safe spot we can talk.

*Follow Grace O'Malley to a Safe Location*

*GRACE O'MALLEY* -- Well now, can't tell you what a relief it was seeing someone who was still human. I was beginning to think I was all alone out here... the rest of the world had gone mad.

*PLAYER* -- There's actually a watchtower nearby.

*GRACE O'MALLEY* -- Perfect, I was betting there'd be some kind of town nearby. Thinking I'd go look for it after I'm done out here. But I'm not about to go walking away from a fleet of freshly crashed boats, not if I have a choice in the matter.

## Lessons of a Pirate's Life

*GRACE O'MALLEY* -- This isn't my first shipwreck, you know? One thing I've learned, you have to always think ahead, keep an eye on the horizon. And there's booty to be had here, countless treasures captain and crew had stashed onboard, if you know where to look.

*PLAYER* -- You're looting these ships?

*GRACE O'MALLEY* -- Of course. Not like these rotters care a damn for it, and I'll be needing a new ship, a new crew... that takes coin. In fact, if you want to partner up, I'll split the loot 70-30, or what the hell, 60-40 even! What do you say? Then we can head to that watchtower of yours.

*PLAYER* -- How about an even split?

*GRACE O'MALLEY* -- That's the spirit! It's a deal! I need to circle back to my own ship to grab what I can, but there's a wreck over there I haven't searched yet. Find the manifest first, then look for whatever's listed. I'll meet you over there. Fortune smile on you, mate.

*Search the shipwreck for a manifest and locate the valuable items on the list. Find and speak to Grace O'Malley when you're done.*

*GRACE O'MALLEY* inc-- Well now, we aren't getting any younger, are we? Let's grab it while we can.

*VOICE* -- And they shall steal from one another... like rats fighting over scraps...

*Search the wreck of La Roussette*

*Read the Ship's Manifest*

*LORE NOTE COLLECTED* -- We set forth from Honfleur with a hold full of cargo, and a handful of uniquely valuable items from Paris as a gift to the soldiers at the new fort. These items include a Silver Candelabra from the Court of the late King Henry the Great, a Blessed Chalice from Bishop Richelieu of the Church at Lucon, and an Astrolabe used by Samuel de Champlain himself during an earlier voyage across the Great Western Ocean.

*Search for the Valuables listed on the Manifest*

*GRACE O'MALLEY* -- There you are - I was starting to worry. More importantly, though - what did you find? Let's see here... Ooh, yes, these are definitely worth a coin or two. Soon as we find a town, we'll sell them and split the profit.


## Memories of Grace

*GRACE O'MALLEY* -- Unfortunately, I didn't have as much luck as you did. Those damn red-eyed rotters are swarming all over the wreckage of my ship. I worry it's bad luck leaving behind my own treasures, but I can't get through the bastards.

*PLAYER* -- You want me to try?

*GRACE O'MALLEY* -- Now, there's a good mate. Tough one too, if you're so confident. No complaints, though. Tell you what, if you can get my stuff back, I'll give you a greater share of our profits, 40-60... or what the hell? 30-70. What do you say?

*PLAYER* -- It's a deal. What am I looking for?

*GRACE O'MALLEY* -- Most of our cargo was lost at sea, and I got my captain's log on the way out. What's burning me now is leaving behind my ship's flag and my lucky wheel - get those, and then maybe we meet at that watchtower. Works for me!

*Search the wreck of The Satisfaction to recover Grace's items*

*Collect Stern Flag*

*Collect Bow Flag*

*Collect Ship Wheel*

*Return to the {POITags}*

*GRACE O'MALLEY* INC -- Your watcher friend there really wants a word with you. You should talk to him first.

## Team Effort

*WATCHER LLEYSON REESE* -- Welcome back, my friend. Glad to see you're still with us. I was elated to meet another survivor, but I feared we'd lost you in the process. Grace O'Malley, a real piece of work, isn't she? Can't say I would've wanted to make that trade.

*WATCHER LLEYSON REESE* -- While you were away, I think I may have located the source of this endless storm. There's a network of sea caves nearby where the Corrupted seem to be gathering. Something nefarious is going on in there, I feel certain of it.

*PLAYER* -- We should check it out.

*WATCHER LLEYSON REESE* -- See? Now there's someone willing to step up. I can't do this alone. I thought perhaps our new friend might join as well, but she's not really the joining type, is she?

*PLAYER* -- I can talk to her.

*WATCHER LLEYSON REESE* -- I suspect you'll be wasting your breath, but give it a go... why not, right? I'll go ahead and scout out the entrance to the caves. Whether she comes or not, I'll meet you there.

*WATCHER LLEYSON REESE* INC -- I'll be waiting for you by the entrance to the sea caves. Don't waste too much time on a lost cause, eh.

*Talk to Grace O'Malley and then meet Watcher Reese near the entrance to the sea caves.*

*Ask Grace for help*

*GRACE O'MALLEY* -- Look, I'm as grateful as can be that you reclaimed my flag and all. But don't ask me to go on a fool crusade against those red-eyed demons. I don't need a medal of valor. Just the coin for me, thank you very much.

*PLAYER* -- Where will you go?

*GRACE O'MALLEY* -- Good old "Watcher Lleyson Reese" says there's a town. I'll head there and sell this loot. I'll set your part aside until you get there. For my part, I'll be saving up for a ship to escape this hellish island.

*PLAYER* -- Didn't you hear about the Stormwall?

*GRACE O'MALLEY* -- Oh, I heard a lot of stuff from "Watcher Lleyson Reese," but I don't believe even half of it. Besides, Captain Grace O'Malley never met a storm she couldn't navigate. I'll find a way. You can come with me, if you like.

*PLAYER* -- "I'll meet you in town, at least.

*GRACE O'MALLEY* V1 -- Have it your way, hero. I just hope you don't end up as one of those monsters yourself. Don't worry about me burning you on the loot. You did me a favor, and I'm good for it. As long as you survive, that is... I'll be there.

*GRACE O'MALLEY* V2 -- I may not be going with you, but it doesn't mean I don't wish you luck. You seem to have a solid share of it, so we'll see each other again. I'd wager money on it.

*VOICE* -- What's begun... cannot be stopped, not by the people of this island... and not by you...

*Catch up with Watcher Reese near the entrance to the Sea Caves*

## Demon Storm

*Talk to Lleyson Reese*

*WATCHER LLEYSON REESE* -- Hey, you gave it a try, at least. That Grace O'Malley's a pirate to the bone. Doesn't care about anyone but herself. Looking at the Corrupted massing here, however, neither her nor anyone else will be safe, if this keeps up.

*WATCHER LLEYSON REESE* -- The storm is centered right above these caves , no doubt about it. And I suspect some foul magic is afoot in there - the place reeks of charred bones and unbridled brutality.

*PLAYER* -- Ready to go in?

*WATCHER LLEYSON REESE* -- I don't know. If we both fall in there, there'll be no one to get word to town. I certainly don't trust that pirate to do so. I say we head back to town and recruit as many sword-arms as we can, and then come back.

*PLAYER* -- There's no time. I'll go alone.

*WATCHER LLEYSON REESE* -- Damn it! I'd forbid it, but I fear you're right... their numbers are growing too fast. Go then, but be quick about it. Look for the source of the storm and destroy it. I'll meet you back at the Watchtower. Godspeed, my friend.

*WATCHER LLEYSON REESE* INC -- Be careful in there. And remember - I didn't ask you to do this, you volunteered!

*Search the Sea Caves and destroy anything that might be the source of the Corruption Storm. Report back to Watcher Reese at the Watchtower when you're done.*

*VOICE* -- And they shall witness the power manifest... the true future of the human race...

*Investigate {POITags}*

*Enter the {POITags} and Search for the Source of the Corruption*

*Defeat the {targetName} and Disrupt the Storm Ritual*

*Destroy the Objects to Disrupt the Corrupted Ritual*

*VOICE* -- You steal that which is mine... you assault my followers... and now you disrupt my plans... this is personal...

*WATCHER LLEYSON REESE* -- God's teeth! When I saw the storm receding, I knew you had triumphed!What was in there? Some kind of abomination? A Corruption Rift? I've heard legends of such things from way back.

*PLAYER* -- It was some kind of ritual.

*WATCHER LLEYSON REESE* -- And you disrupted it? That's a story fit for legend right there, I'd say. You have no idea what a relief this is. I didn't want to sound pessimistic, but nothing like this has happened in the three hundred years I've been here.

## Bearer of Bad Tidings

*WATCHER LLEYSON REESE* -- Those who've been here longer  - the ones who haven't been driven mad by all the years - they tell horror stories about the Corrupted. It seems that centuries ago, some dark sorcerer nearly Corrupted everyone on the island.

*PLAYER* -- Do you think it's happening again?

*WATCHER LLEYSON REESE* -- I suspect we'll see more Corrupted in the future, but let's hope we can prevent such darkness as the legends speak of. Still, I'll write a report for the town, tell them the storm's receded, but to remain vigilant.

*PLAYER* -- Can I deliver the report?

*WATCHER LLEYSON REESE* -- I hate to ask you to be the bearer of bad tidings, but I should stay here. Just deliver the report to the guard at the gate. Then get yourself a nice cup of mead at the tavern, you deserve it.

*WATCHER LLEYSON REESE* INC -- When you get to town, reward yourself with a cup of mead at the tavern. You deserve it, my friend.

*WATCHER LLEYSON REESE* INC -- It's always nice to see a friendly face - down here it's just the haggard and the desperate. I will return to town at some point... I hope we can have a cup of mead together when I do.

*Travel to the town of Corinth (WINDSWARD) and deliver the Watcher's report*
*Travel to the town of Prydwen (MONARCH'S BLUFFS) and deliver the Watcher's report*

*Follow the Road that leads to Town and Deliver the Watcher's Report*

*VOICE* -- Come closer... it is time you know the whole truth...

*Investigate the Ancient Statue*

## Truffle Fever

*HAPLESS HOWE* -- Did you see my cart? The wilds of Aeternum have never been safe, but the roads?Never seen anything like this before today! Vicious boars came out of nowhere - ate all my truffles!

*HAPLESS HOWE* -- Oh, I think we'll be seeing more of each other down the road a piece. Yes, indeed. Always down the road a piece.

*PLAYER* -- Why would they do that?

*HAPLESS HOWE* -- How should I know? Do I look like some kind of "boar-mind-reader"? Not me. I'm just a simple Traveling Herbalist.Tell you this much, however, the beasts have ruined me for the season.

*PLAYER* -- Any way I can help?

*HAPLESS HOWE* -- You mean... you'd help old Hapless Howe? Why yes! You're a saint! Take my sickle, hunt up some Truffles, and bring them to the settlement.Gather any herbs or berries you see for yourself as well - they'll fetch a gold or two at the Trading Post!

*Collect any Truffles you can find in the forest and bring them to Hapless Howe in the settlement. Look for any Herbs or Berries you can gather as well.*

*HAPLESS HOWE* INC -- Sad days are these when a traveling Herbalist has to rely on the goodwill of a stranger to make ends meet.But if you'll bring me some truffles in the settlement, I'll have a little something for you.

*Equip the Sickle from Herbalist Howe*

*Gather Truffles around the marked area*

*(Optional) Gather Herbs or Berries*

*HAPLESS HOWE* -- Here's my new friend, right here! All the truffles I lost and then some! I hope it wasn't too hard!Keep that sickle for your troubles, and if you make a habit of Harvesting herbs and such, we'll cross paths again, no doubt.
